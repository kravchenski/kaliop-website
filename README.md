# Kaliop Profile Clone (Responsive)

A responsive **Kaliop profile** clone built with **Vite**, **Sass (SCSS)**, **PNPM**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3**. This project follows a **mobile-first approach**, includes **Google Fonts**, **SVG icons**, and uses a **modular SCSS architecture** with variables and at least one desktop breakpoint.
